This repository contains a list of IP addresses that have attempted to connect
to my personal server through the SSH port or other authenticated requests and
failed miserably.

The file `iplist.txt' contains the IP addresses, sorted numerically and
contains exactly one address per line along with its associated country at the
time of insertion.

The file `ipretract.txt' contains all IP addresses that have been appealed.

Some people may argue that banning an IP address is counter-intuitive because
they may be dynamic and shared around. If you are one of these people, this
repository is not for you.

If you do not care like myself, you will find this list useful. You can modify
or use it in any way you wish such as adding it into a database such as
fail2ban or adding it to your `/etc/hosts' file.

If you wish to have your IP removed from `ipretract.txt', your request will be
denied.

If your IP appears in `iplist.txt' and you wish to have it removed, please
appeal by opening an Issue and you will be judged accordingly. If your IP is
removed from `iplist.txt', it will be moved into `ipretract.txt'.
